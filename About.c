  This is a game popularized on the CBS sitcom THE BIG BANG THEORY.
  Sheldon explains how the game works: "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
  This project is a work in progress. Enjoy!
